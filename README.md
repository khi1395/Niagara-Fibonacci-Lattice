This is an hlsl code for Unreal Engine. Niagara system is used to make a mesh that is normally used in making FX for games. 
Making that static mesh in Niagara offers more flexibity on the controls it offers.
This uses fibonacci lattice to uniformly spawn points, so there is no clustering of cones which happens if points are spawned at random.
Ribbons are used to cones thus allowing us dynamically change all the aspects of the shape.
